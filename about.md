I'm a software developer based in South Leicestershire.

Currently, my main commercial language is OpenEdge - a 4GL language from [Progress](https://www.progress.com/openedge). However, I am currently expanding my language skills and making a foray in to the .NET stack.

I'm hoping to learn C#, MySQL and Xamarin as a starting point; but I'm sure that there will be lots of other things that I'll pick up along the way (for instance, the Markdown language that I'm using to write this, and the use of GitHub)!

As part of that, I've decided to blog my learning process and upload some of my projects to GitHub.

### A little bit more...

Outside of the technology field I also enjoy flexing my DIY skills - having bought a house that needed some modernisation (on a budget) I've learnt many new skills along the way. So, I'll also be blogging about some of my previous projects, and also those moving forwards.
