title: Bird table/box - Part 1
---

Several years ago I knocked together a very quick bird table, expecting it not to stand for very long. It surprised me by lasting a couple of years, but during this winter's high winds it blew over and broke. It's been sat in a heap ever since so I finally decided to sort it out and build a replacement.

I spent some time searching Google for ideas when I came across a YouTube video including plans by [Greg Virgoe](https://youtu.be/V8EQDE9JXtM) that I decided to follow.

A couple of weekends later and here is the result so far:

![Bird table - 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/BirdTable_2.jpg)

Before it goes out in to the garden it will require a coat of paint, and inside the bird box roof I've created a third section inside which I intend to hide a couple of IR cameras (probably Raspberry Pi powered) so that I can keep an eye on any wildlife visitors.
